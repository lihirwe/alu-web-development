In this project, the goal is to implement a webpage using pure HTML semantic structure based on a designer file. The project requires replicating the design provided in a Figma file, focusing solely on HTML markup without any CSS or styling. The designer file can be accessed through the following links:

- [Page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/dyYL6Ku4WG7vsdpwvlcJZC/Homepage?node-id=0%3A1&mode=dev)
- [fig file](https://intranet.aluswe.com/rltoken/BOC4LSHhGgn-RudlXjuUKg)  

The project involves duplicating the design from the Figma file, ensuring that the HTML structure closely matches the provided design details. It is essential to pay attention to specific instructions and considerations mentioned in the designer file regarding fonts and rounding values.
